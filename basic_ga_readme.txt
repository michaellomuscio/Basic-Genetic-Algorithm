# Basic Genetic Algorithm Example

## Overview
This example demonstrates a basic genetic algorithm that aims to generate a target string starting from random strings.

## How to Use
- Open `index.html` in a web browser.
- The algorithm will automatically start and you'll see the generation of strings evolve over time until it matches the target string.

## Mechanism
The genetic algorithm uses the following mechanisms:
- **Selection**: Strings that are closer to the target have a higher chance of being selected.
- **Crossover**: Two parent strings are combined to produce a new string.
- **Mutation**: There's a small chance that some characters in a string might randomly change.
